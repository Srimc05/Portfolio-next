            Toggle Theme
          </button>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
```

We can then add some basic styling to our application using Tailwind CSS. We can do this by creating a new file called `styles.css` in the `styles` directory of our project.

In this file, we can add the following code to apply some basic styles to our application:

```
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    body {
      background-color: #f7fafc;
    .container {
      max-width: 800px;
```

## Implementing the Dark Mode Toggle

Now that our basic application structure and styling are complete, we can move on to implementing the dark mode toggle functionality.

To do this, we need to create a state variable to track the user's preferred theme. We can do this by adding the following code to our `index.js` file:

```
    import { useState from "react";

    export default function Home() {
      const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

      return (
        <div className={theme === "light" ? "bg-white" : "bg-gray-800      <div className="container mx-auto py-4">
            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to my Dark Mode Toggle!</h1>
            <p className="text-lg">Click the button below to switch between light and dark mode.</p>
            <button
              className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
              onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light        >
              Toggle Theme
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
```

In this code, we are using the `useState` hook from React to create a state variable called `theme`. The default value of `theme` is set to `"light"`.

We are also using a ternary operator to conditionally apply a background color to our application based on the user's preferred theme. If the user has selected the light theme, we apply a white background color. If the user has selected the dark theme, we apply a dark gray background color.

We are also using an `onClick` event handler to toggle the user's preferred theme between light and dark.

## Improving the User Experience

Now that we have implemented the basic functionality of our dark mode toggle, we can improve the user experience by adding some additional features.

First, we can persist the user's theme preference using localStorage. We can do this by adding the following code to our `index.js` file:

```
    import { useEffect, useState from "react";

    export default function Home() {
      const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

      useEffect(() => {
        const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
        if (savedTheme) {
          setTheme(savedTheme);
         []);

      useEffect(() => {
        localStorage.setItem("theme", theme);
      [theme]);

      return (
        <div className={theme === "light" ? "bg-white" : "bg-gray-800      <div className="container mx-auto py-4">
            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to my Dark Mode Toggle!</h1>
            <p className="text-lg">Click the button below to switch between light and dark mode.</p>
            <button
              className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
              onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light        >
              Toggle Theme
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
```

In this code, we are using the `useEffect` hook from React to load the user's preferred theme from localStorage when the component mounts. We are also using another `useEffect` hook to save the user's preferred theme to localStorage whenever it changes.

Next, we can add some animations to our toggle button to enhance user feedback. We can do this by adding the following code to our `styles.css` file:

```
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    body {
      background-color: #f7fafc;
    .container {
      max-width: 800px;
    .theme-toggle {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 2rem;
      right: 2rem;
    .theme-toggle-button {
      width: 60px;
      height: 30px;
      border-radius: 15px;
      position: relative;
    .theme-toggle-button::before {
      content: "";
      width: 30px;
      height: 30px;
      border-radius: 50%;
      background-color: #fff;
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: ${({ theme => (theme === "light" ? "0" : "30px")  transition: all .2s ease-in-out;
    .theme-toggle-button::after {
      content: "";
      width: 30px;
      height: 30px;
      border-radius: 50%;
      background-color: #000;
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      right: ${({ theme => (theme === "light" ? "0" : "30px")  transition: all .2s ease-in-out;
    .theme-toggle-button:hover::before {
      transform: scale(1.2);
    .theme-toggle-button:hover::after {
      transform: scale(1.2);
```

In this code, we are using CSS to create a toggle button with two states - light and dark. We are also using CSS transitions to animate the button when it is hovered over.

Finally, we can implement a media query to automatically switch between light and dark themes based on the user's device settings. We can do this by adding the following code to our `styles.css` file:

```
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      body {
        background-color: #1a202c;
       .text-gray-800 {
        color: #fff;
       }
    }
```

In this code, we are using a media query to check for the user's preferred color scheme. If the user has selected a dark color scheme, we apply a dark background color and change the text color to white.
